## Case Study: Clothing Retail Data Analysis

### Introduction
Analyzed two clothing retail datasets to identify trends in product sales and seasonal demand.

### The Problem Statement
Poppy is considering starting her own boutique but is uncertain about how seasons impact sales throughout the year. She is interested in how data-driven insights can help start her business.

### Solution
To address this, I analyzed clothing retail data to understand how seasons influence demand for clothing products. Based on the findings, I will make recommendations to help Poppy guide decisions around inventory planning, marketing, and pricing strategies for her new boutique.

### Data

- Public dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratyushpuri/retail-fashion-boutique-data-sales-analytics-2025
- A synthetic fashion retail dataset containing 2,176 real-world style records spanning seasonal collections, customer purchasing behavior, pricing strategies, and return analytics

<u>Dataset 2: Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset</u>

- A synthetic dataset containing approximately 3900 records providing insights into consumers' preferences, tendencies, and patterns during their shopping experiences
   
Tools: Excel, SQL, Tableau

### Process
1. Cleaned the data and created pivot tables in Excel.
- Checked for duplicates
- Formatted data types
- Converted the markdown percentage from decimal to percentage
- Checked for misspellings using the filter function
  
2. Cleaned and structured the data in SQL.
- Changed all column names delimited by spaces to be delimited by underscores
- Used "DISTINCT" queries on text-based columns to make sure there were no misspellings
- Checked each column for null values
- Validated the data (particularly purchase amounts, purchase dates, and customer ages)
- <u>Found and excluded a purchase date related outlier</u>
  
3. Created data visualizations in Tableau.
